//Everyone in your break out room will be working on this TRIANGLE face shape. 

//Feel free to style the face template and add to it, but don't change or move the base face triangle - you'll see why tomorrow.

//Pick a different emotion/mood/character for everyone in your group to create and then fork this project and get started. :)
