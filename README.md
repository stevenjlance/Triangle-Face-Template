# Custom Emoji Project (Oval Template)
All the way back in 1999, The first emoji was invented when Shigetaka Kurita invented a heart emoji to send to Japanese pagers. Kurita drew inspiration from marks used in weather forecasts and from kanji characters to design a set of 176 symbols that covered a range of human emotions.

Since Kurita's invention a little more than 20 years ago, emojis have exploded in popularity. This massive libary of what is and is not an emoji is managed by the Unicode Consortium. Currently there are 3521 approved emojis with ðŸ˜‚ emoji being the most popular emoji.
